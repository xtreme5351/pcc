# pcc
My handmade compiler - stands for Pranav's Cool Compiler.

Basic variable assignment works in theory.
Memory actually needs to be allocated and is a work in progress.
Other basic features of a language also need to be implemented.

This is probably like V0.0.01

Apologies for any sins commited.
